> Developing robust clustering methodologies for complex data.

PhD Candidate in Statistics specializing in **Cluster Analysis, Probabilistic Distance Methods, and Data Diagnostics**.

I work at the intersection of statistical theory and applied survey analytics, developing methods that improve clustering reliability and interpretability.

Over 6 years of experience in large-scale socio-economic surveys, urban analytics, and policy-oriented data research.
