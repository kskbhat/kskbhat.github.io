My doctoral research focuses on **Block Probabilistic Distance Clustering (BPDQ)** and its diagnostic measures — work that has resulted in peer-reviewed publications, R packages on CRAN, and invited conference presentations.

## Research Interests

- **Cluster Analysis** — Theory and methods for partitioning data into meaningful groups
- **Block Clustering (Co-clustering)** — Simultaneous clustering of rows and columns of data matrices
- **Probabilistic Distance Clustering** — Distance-based approaches with probabilistic foundations
- **Cluster Diagnostics** — Silhouette-based and density-based measures for evaluating clustering quality
- **Statistical Computing** — Development of R packages for reproducible research
- **Survey Analytics** — Design and analysis of large-scale socio-economic surveys
- **Applied Statistics** — Regression modeling, multivariate analysis, and data-driven inference

### Key Contributions

1. **Density-Based Silhouette Diagnostics** — Proposed novel silhouette diagnostics for evaluating soft clustering algorithms, extending the classical silhouette framework to accommodate fuzzy and probabilistic cluster memberships.

2. **Block Probabilistic Distance Clustering** — Developed a unified framework for block (co-)clustering using probabilistic distance methods, with theoretical foundations and extensive empirical validation.

3. **R Packages** — Built and published open-source software:
   - [Silhouette](https://kskbhat.github.io/Silhouette) — CRAN package for proximity measure based diagnostics
   - [blockclusterPDQ](https://github.com/kskbhat/blockclusterPDQ) — R package for block probabilistic distance clustering
