## Quick Guide — Adding a Bookdown / R Markdown Book

**Option A — Link to an external hosted book:**

Add a new card in the section below with the title, description, and URL.

**Option B — Host the book within this site:**

1. Build your bookdown/R Markdown book locally (e.g., `bookdown::render_book()`)
2. Copy the rendered output (HTML files) into a subfolder like `notes/my-book-name/`
3. Add a card entry below pointing to `notes/my-book-name/index.html`

**Option C — Use a GitHub Pages link:**

If your book is hosted on GitHub Pages (e.g., `https://kskbhat.github.io/my-notes/`), just link to it directly.
