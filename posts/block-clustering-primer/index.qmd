## What Is Block Clustering?

Unlike traditional clustering that groups only rows (observations), **block clustering** (also called **co-clustering** or **biclustering**) simultaneously groups both rows and columns of a data matrix. This reveals hidden block structures in the data.

### Why Block Clustering?

Consider a gene expression dataset: you want to find groups of genes (rows) that behave similarly across groups of experimental conditions (columns). Block clustering finds these meaningful row–column combinations automatically.

### The Probabilistic Distance Approach

Our framework combines:

1. **Probabilistic distances** — measuring how "far" each observation is from each cluster center in probability space
2. **Block structure** — jointly partitioning rows and columns
3. **Flexible distributions** — supporting Gaussian, $t$-distributions, and non-parametric distances

$$d_{PD}(x_i, \mu_k) = -2 \log f(x_i \mid \theta_k)$$

### Evaluating Block Clustering

We modified the Extended Silhouette Index to assess block clustering quality alongside the Co-clustering Adjusted Rand Index.

```r
# Coming soon: blockclusterPDQ example
library(blockclusterPDQ)

# Fit block clustering model
# Evaluate using Extended Silhouette
# Visualize co-cluster structure
```

### Coming Soon

Detailed tutorials with code examples and real-data applications will be published here. Watch this space!
