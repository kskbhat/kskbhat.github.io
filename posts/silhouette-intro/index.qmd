## What Are Silhouette Diagnostics?

Silhouette analysis is one of the most widely used tools for evaluating the quality of a clustering solution. Introduced by Rousseeuw (1987), the silhouette width quantifies how well each observation fits within its assigned cluster compared to neighboring clusters.

### The Classical Silhouette

For each observation $i$ in cluster $C_k$, we compute:

$$s(i) = \frac{b(i) - a(i)}{\max\{a(i), b(i)\}}$$

where:

- $a(i)$ = average distance to all other points in the same cluster
- $b(i)$ = minimum average distance to points in any other cluster

Values range from $-1$ (poor fit) to $+1$ (excellent fit).

### Beyond Hard Clustering

What happens when clusters overlap? Traditional silhouette methods assume hard assignments, but many real-world problems require **soft (fuzzy) clustering**. That's where density-based silhouette diagnostics come in.

```r
# Coming soon: example using the Silhouette R package
library(Silhouette)

# Fit a soft clustering model
# Compute density-based silhouette widths
# Visualize results
```

### What's Next

In upcoming posts, I'll walk through:

1. Density-based silhouette methods for soft clustering
2. Extended silhouette for block clustering
3. Practical examples with the `Silhouette` R package

*Stay tuned!*
