## From Research Code to CRAN Package

Turning a collection of research scripts into a polished, CRAN-ready R package is a journey. Here are some lessons I've learned while developing `Silhouette` and `blockclusterPDQ`.

### 1. Start with `usethis` and `devtools`

```r
# Scaffold your package
usethis::create_package("myPackage")
usethis::use_testthat()
usethis::use_vignette("getting-started")
```

### 2. Write Tests Early

Don't wait until the package is "done" — write tests as you code each function.

### 3. Document with `roxygen2`

Keep documentation close to the code. Future-you will thank present-you.

### 4. CRAN Submission Tips

- Run `R CMD check --as-cran` locally before submitting
- Pay attention to NOTEs — CRAN reviewers will
- Keep examples fast (< 5 seconds each)

### More Details Coming Soon

I'll expand each of these into detailed posts with real examples from my package development experience.

*Stay tuned!*
