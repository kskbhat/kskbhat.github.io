## 🚧 Blog Launching Soon

I'm excited to announce that this blog is under construction! I'll be sharing insights from my research and experience in:

- **Cluster Analysis** — New methods, diagnostics, and practical applications
- **R Programming** — Tips, tricks, and package development stories  
- **Statistical Theory** — Making complex ideas accessible
- **Academic Life** — Conference experiences, publishing tips, and more

### What to Expect

Each post will combine **rigorous methodology** with **practical R code examples** so you can apply techniques directly to your own data.

### Stay Connected

In the meantime, check out my [publications](/publications.html) and [software](/software.html) pages for my latest work. You can also subscribe to the **RSS feed** for this blog to get notified when new posts go live.
